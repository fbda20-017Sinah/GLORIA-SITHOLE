				<div class="film">The middle of an oil refinery may seem an odd place to visit a nature sanctuary, but this is one of the best bird-watching spots in Trinidad. Surrounded by lush tropical foliage, the 30-hectare sanctuary encompasses an interpretive center and nature trails along lily-topped lakes, where you can spot species such as the scarlet ibis, black-bellied whistling duck, and white-cheeked pintail.This is a great spot for photographers hoping to catch a close-up shot of one of these feathered beauties.The Pointe-a-Pierre Wildfowl Trust protects the sanctuary and operates rehabilitation and captive breeding programs for endangered species.</div>

				<div class="real_name">Main Ridge Forest Reserve, Tobago</div>
				<div class="film">Rich in biodiversity, the Main Ridge Forest Reserve is purportedly the oldest legally protected forest in the Western Hemisphere. The reserve harbors more than half the island's bird species, including the blue-backed manakin, collared trogon, and many species of hummingbirds - the rare white-tailed sabrewing hummingbird is also a resident here.Hiking through the lush foliage, you can also spot frogs, lizards, snakes, and butterflies. The road through the reserve from north to south, near the eastern end of Tobago, is one of the more scenic ways to see the forest. At the top of the ridge are hiking trails and freelance guides.</div>
