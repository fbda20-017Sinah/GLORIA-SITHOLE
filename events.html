				<div class="real_name">Trinidad and Tobago Carnival</div>
				<div class="film">Known as the biggest street party on Earth- Trinidad and Tobago’s Carnival is officially celebrated on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday every year. The Carnival festivities start just after Christmas and continues until Ash Wednesday-loaded with dozens of high energy parties and premier cultural competitions. Carnival Monday opens with J’Ouvert at 4am, when revellers parade through the streets immersed in paint, grease and mud until sunrise. Later in the day on Monday and all day on Carnival Tuesday, thousands of masqueraders flood the streets throughout the islands in bold, colourful costumes, dancing through the parade routes to the exhilarating sounds of soca, steelpan and calypso music.From its diverse people and culture to its amazing biodiversity, Trinidad and Tobago breaks the mould of the typical Caribbean destination. These islands boast a year-long calendar of cultural events and festivals on both islands, friendly, multi-ethnic people and amazing opportunities for eco-adventure: everything from birding to biking to hiking to diving and cave exploring.  </div>

				<div class="real_name">PANORAMA</div>
				<div class="film">Held on the Saturday before Carnival at the Queen's Park Savannah, the Panorama Competition is another significant feature of Trinidad and Tobago’s Carnival.  Recognized as the pre-eminent steel band competition in the world, Panorama is an annual music competition open to both conventional and single pan steel bands in four main categories: Large Conventional Steel bands, Medium Conventional Steel bands, Small Conventional Steel bands and  Single Pan Bands.  Up to 100 musicians rhythmically beat their pan sticks against the steelpans to create infectious music that seems to fuel the desire to dance. Created in the 1930’s, the steel pan is the national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago and is widely accepted as the only musical instrument created in the 20th century.</div>
