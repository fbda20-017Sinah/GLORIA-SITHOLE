				<p>Trinidad and Port of Spain, its largest city, has a very diverse culture which comes from the large mix of ethnicities among its people.  The island, once the property of Spain, has also been home to many French and also British who took the island from Spain in the 1700's.  Originally, most of the country's people were of African descent, ancestors of the slaves who were brought to the island by the Europeans to work the sugar cane fields.  A large number of people in Port of Spain also have origins in India and the Far East, their ancestors having been brought to the island as traders. Indeed, because the slave trade in Trinidad was ended earlier than some neighbouring islands, the British Crown imported indentured laborers from India to continue to extract profits from the lucrative sugar industry on the island.  As a result, the island's population is roughly split 40%/40% African and Indian descent, with the remaining portion "dougla" or mixed black and Indian, along with a healthy smattering of native Trinis of Chinese descent.Spanish is also spoken frequently in Trinidad, as it is located only 7 miles north of Venezuela and is an attractive destination for Venezuelans who want to learn to speak English, Trinidad's official language.A bustling and friendly city, Port of Spain is a great place to spend a couple of days and is the hub for the Trinidad's famous carnival. It has been the capital since 1757 and is the main administrative center, although not the largest town.

The main shopping area is between Frederick Street and Charlotte Street, running south to Independence Square (Brian Lara Promenade). As well as the bricks-and-mortar shops, there are numerous stalls on the street selling everything from fruit to CDs.

In the evening Independence Square is full of locals liming - hanging around, chatting to their friends and sampling food from the stalls scattered throughout. Wandering through here is a great way to get a feel for what Trinidad is about. Browse through the<a href="facts.html">facts</a> of the city
